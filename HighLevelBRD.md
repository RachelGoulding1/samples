# Automated Discount Codes


## Business Problem  

An abandoned basket email is sent to all customers who drop out of the sales journey during the checkout step (approx 7500 customers per day).  25% (1875) of customers open and read the abandoned basket email but currently less than 2% (38) of those who read the email return to the sales journey to complete their purchase.

The Trading team would like to improve the abandoned basket sales process and encourage customers back to complete their purchase.

## Business Opportunity

The Trading team believe that allowing a customer to return to the basket with the discount applied with a single click will have a significant impact on the number of customers who return to the sales journey.


## Business Outcome

The trading team expect at least 10% (188) of customers to return to the sales journey if the email is improved.

## Measurement Criteria

* Basket visits increase for sales journey entry type 'abandonEmail'  
* Conversion rate increase by 300% for sales journey entry type 'abandonEmail'
