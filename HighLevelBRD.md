# Automated Offer Codes


## Business Problem  

An abandoned basket email is sent to all customers who drop out of the sales journey during the checkout step (approx 7500 customers per day).  25% (1875) of customers open and read the abandoned basket email but currently less than 2% (38) of those who read the email return to the sales journey to complete their purchase.

The trading team would like to improve the abandoned basket sales process and encourage customers back to complete their purchase.


## Business Opportunity

The trading team believe that allowing a customer to return to the basket with an offer applied with a single click will have a significant impact on the number of customers who return to the sales journey to complete their purchase.

The automatic offer codes may be used within other marketing emails and online journeys but the abandoned basket customers have been flagged as a key opportunity.


## Business Outcome

The trading team expect at least 10% (188) of customers to return to the sales journey if the email is improved.


## Measurement Criteria

* Basket visits increase for sales journey entry type 'abandonEmail'  
* Conversion rate increase by 300% for sales journey entry type 'abandonEmail'

## Non Functional Requirements


### Volume 

|                           |Hourly | Daily | Weekly |Monthly |
|---------------------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
|Abandoned basket emails    |  n/a  | 7,500 | 55,000 | 210,000|
|Basket traffic             |  30   | 180   | 1400   | 5250   |
|New Orders                 |  9    | 54    | 420    | 1575   |

**Notes:**

Hourly assumes most customers will visit the website within 6 hours of recieving the email  
Basket traffic assumes a 10% click through rate of the 25% who read the email  
New Orders assumes a 30% conversion rate


**Suggestion:**

Thorough integration testng should be performed for each dicount code type from URL generation to email creation to basket creation. A load test is not required as the additional load from this feature sits comfortably within existing daily tolerances.


### Speed

The basket page should load with the discounted prices in less than 0.2 seconds, there should be no percieved wait time for the user.


### Security

Existing security best practices should be applied and considered when generating and sending emails.


## Assumptions

* No changes are required to the way discount codes are currently set up and managed within ref data
* No changes are required to the way discounts are currently displayed within the basket
* Existing error messages will be used
* Marketing may use the dicount deeplinks in other scenarios such as landing page promo's, PPC or display ads
* No changes are required to existing reporting for entry types


## Risks and Issues

* Existing invalid basket messages may not work as expected so some investigation and additional work maybe required to update basket messages.
